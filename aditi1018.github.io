<h1>About Us</h1>
 <p>
Welcome to Vidya Prasarak Mandal's Polytechnic Thane. The Self-financed Institute was founded in the year 1983 by a group of dedicated and philanthropic visionaries after receiving the approval from the State Govt. The Institute was subsequently recognized by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) New Delhi and has already achieved many distinctions and credentials.
In its constant endeavor to impart Quality Technical Education, Institute is one of the self-financed Polytechnics in the Mumbai Sub Region to get all the four eligible Diploma programmes accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) New Delhi for a period of Three years w.e.f. 19/03/2004. In the year 2017, all the existing programs got provisionally accredited till 30/06/2019. The Quality process guided by our Management in general and Institution in particular has been the steering agent for enabling the four Diploma Programmes i.e. Computer Engineering, Information Technology and Electrical Power System and Industrial Electronics to be accredited for a further period of 3 years up to 30th June 2026.Polytechnic at present holds a rare distinction of forth time Accreditation amongst MSBTE Affiliated Polytechnics in the State.
So far over 20,000 Certificate Course, Diploma and Advance Diploma holders have passed out from this Polytechnic till date. Most of our Alumni are successfully working in different Sectors and some are running their own Enterprises.The Alumni Association "SnehBandh" is formed in 2018, making its own contribution in gathering the details of all the passed out students since beginning. Their efforts in Institutional future development will help Polytechnic to scale new heights. I complement the present office bearers and all the Alumni who enthusiastically contribute in whatever form they can unconditionally, whenever opportunity is offered to them.
Through Institution Innovation Cell (IIC), Entrepreneurship cell and many more novel initiatives, Polytechnic is trying to attain the National level excellence. The good infrastructure with able faculty and diligent students, efforts are made to achieve success in every activity initiated. Polytechnic is making genuine efforts for the Diploma to Degree conversion (Proposed) to offer UG level technical educationfrom the Academic Year 2024-2025, subject to the approval from All India Council for Technical Education New Delhi.<p>
